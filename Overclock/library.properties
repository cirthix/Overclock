sentence=A simple overclocking library for atmega328/168 while keeping serial communications functional.
paragraph=Only for systems using the internal 8MHz oscillator.  System stability may suffer.  Anything that relies on the system clock accuracy (eg: timing and delays) will be wrong. Serial.print/read should still work.
